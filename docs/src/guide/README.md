This is a Laravel package to help promote social proof and legitimacy within your application. With a simple blade component added to any page you can share with potential customers or users that other customers are using and/or paying for your product. A simple pop-up will display in the corner of page with information such as "Someone from New York purchased the business plan 2 minutes ago."
